In this project, I explored HR data in a company using unsupervised learning. Unsupervised learning, finding the patterns or relationships in data, can enhance my understanding of underlying structures within the data without predefined labels or categories. By applying unsupervised learning techniques in HR data, such as clustering or dimensionality reduction, I can gain valuable insights about Employee Retention.

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is all about exploring and understanding the data I am working with before applying models or algorithms.
Before I applied the unsupervised learning, I should In the dataset, For instance, in the HR context, unsupervised learning can help identify distinct groups of employees based on their **EmployeeID, Age, Gender, DistanceFromHome, JobLevel, Department, MonthlyIncome, PerformanceRating, JobSatisfaction, Attrition** with EDA

Moreover, dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can simplify the data, making it easier to visualize and understand without losing significant information.
