In this project, I explored HR data in a company using unsupervised learning. Unsupervised learning, finding the patterns or relationships in data, can enhance my understanding of underlying structures within the data without predefined labels or categories. By applying unsupervised learning techniques in HR data, such as clustering or dimensionality reduction, I can gain valuable insights about Employee Retention.
