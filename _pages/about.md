I am currently looking for an Data Engineer/Machine Learning Engineer position in GTA, starting around 2025 Spring/Summer.

I am a student studying in [AI-Software Engineer Technology](https://www.centennialcollege.ca/programs-courses/full-time/artificial-intelligence-fast-track) at Centennial College, with a primary focus on Big Data and Machine Learning. My current interests lie in the fields of Data Engineering and Machine Learning Engineering.

I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Robotics Engineering and Automation at the [Guangdong University of Technology](https://english.gdut.edu.cn/) between 2015 and 2019, under the supervision of Dr. [Juan Rojas](http://www.juanrojas.net/). For my Bachelor's thesis, I focused on **Human Pose Estimation Based on Deep Learning**.

After graduating, I worked for **four years** at [ZMROBO](https://www.zmrobo.com/) as a [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) software engineer. During this time, I designed multiple AI robots and developed educational robotics courses tailored for schools based on the companyâ€™s robotic products. These experiences enhanced my expertise in robotics software development, ROS integration, and creating practical applications for learning environments.

Simultaneously, I dedicated **three years** to part-time projects in data science, machine learning, and large language models (LLMs). My work encompassed tasks such as **data preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, and fine-tuning LLMs for specific applications**. These projects allowed me to develop robust skills in **Python, SQL, and cloud platforms** like AWS and Azure, while also deepening my ability to manage complex datasets and deploy efficient, scalable models.

In my free time, I enjoy jogging, playing frisbee, reading, listening to Rap and Rock music and exploring new things.
