I am currently looking for an Data Engineer/Machine Learning Engineer position in GTA, starting around 2025 Spring/Summer.

I am a student studying in [AI-Software Engineer Technology](https://www.centennialcollege.ca/programs-courses/full-time/artificial-intelligence-fast-track) at Centennial College. I mainly focus on Big Data and Machine learning. Specifically, my current interests lie in these fields: Data Engineer and Machine Learning Engineer.

I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Robotics Engineering and Automation at the [Guangdong University of Technology](https://english.gdut.edu.cn/) between 2015 and 2019, supervised by Dr. [Juan Rojas](http://www.juanrojas.net/). During my Bachelor's period, I did my Bachelor's thesis on Human Pose Estimation Based on Deep Learning.

After graduating, I worked at [ZMROBO](https://www.zmrobo.com/) as a [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) software engineer, designing multiple sets of AI robots and developing courses for schools based on the company's robotic products.

In the meantime, I worked on part-time projects in data science, as well as machine learning and large language models (LLMs). My responsibilities included tasks such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, and fine-tuning LLMs for specific applications. 

These experiences allowed me to enhance my skills in Python, SQL, and cloud platforms like AWS and Azure, while also improving my ability to handle complex datasets and implement efficient models.

In my free time, I enjoy jogging, playing frisbee, reading, listening to Rap and Rock music and exploring new things.
