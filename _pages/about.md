I am currently looking for an Data Engineer/Machine Learning Engineer position, starting around 2025 Spring/Summer.

I am a student studying in [AI-Software Engineer Technology](https://www.centennialcollege.ca/programs-courses/full-time/artificial-intelligence-fast-track) at Centennial College. I mainly focus on Big Data and Machine learning. Specifically, my current interests lie in these fields: Data Engineer and Machine Learning Engineer.

I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Robotics Engineering and Automation at the [Guangdong University of Technology](https://english.gdut.edu.cn/) between 2015 and 2019, supervised by Dr. [Juan Rojas](http://www.juanrojas.net/). During my Bachelor's period, I did my Bachelor's thesis on Human Pose Estimation Based on Deep Learning.

After graduating, I worked at [ZMROBO](https://www.zmrobo.com/) as a [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) software engineer, designing multiple sets of AI robots and developing courses for schools based on the company's robotic products.

In my free time, I enjoy playing frisbee, reading, listening to Rap and Rock music and exploring new things.
