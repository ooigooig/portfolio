I am currently seeking a Data Engineer or Machine Learning Engineer position in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), starting around Spring/Summer 2025.

I am a student in [AI-Software Engineer Technology](https://www.centennialcollege.ca/programs-courses/full-time/artificial-intelligence-fast-track) at Centennial College, with a primary focus on Big Data and Machine Learning. I have obtained the **AWS Certified Machine Learning Engineer – Associate** certification, further solidifying my expertise in cloud-based machine learning solutions.

I earned my Bachelor's degree in Robotics Engineering and Automation from [Guangdong University of Technology](https://english.gdut.edu.cn/)(2015-2019), under the supervision of Dr. [Juan Rojas](http://www.juanrojas.net/). My Bachelor’s thesis focused on **Human Pose Estimation Based on Deep Learning**.

After graduating, I worked for **four years** at [ZMROBO](https://www.zmrobo.com/) as a [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) software engineer. During this time, I designed multiple AI robots and developed educational robotics courses tailored for schools based on the company’s robotic products. These experiences enhanced my expertise in robotics software development, ROS integration, and creating practical applications for learning environments.

Alongside my full-time role, I spent **three years** working on part-time projects in **data science, machine learning, and large language models (LLMs)**. My work involved **data preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, and fine-tuning LLMs for specific applications**. These experiences allowed me to build strong skills in **Python, SQL, and cloud platforms** like AWS and Azure, while also enhancing my ability to manage complex datasets and deploy efficient, scalable models.

In my free time, I enjoy jogging, playing frisbee, reading, listening to Rap and Rock music and exploring new things.
